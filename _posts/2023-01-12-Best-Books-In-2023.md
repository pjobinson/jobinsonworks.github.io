A new year brings new beginnings to many things! Most of you have already decided to read a book for at least ten minutes a day. 

Well, I too promised myself to read one book per month for the next beautiful 12 months. But I was confused about which book to choose from the vast collection of best sellers. 

So I did some digging in some of the most popular websites in search of the best books in 2023. And prepared a wish list of the best books that might engage my thoughts and cherish my memories for a long time. 

> In this article, I am sharing the 5 most popular books that I wish to read in 2023.

# Top 5 Books in 2023

This list is just a creation of my favorite books based on my likes. 

I have also tried to provide amazon links for all the books listed in this article, where you can grab the best deals compared to other sites.


## 1. We All Want Impossible Things: by Catherine Newman

If you think you are a gregarious person, then this book from Catherine Newman is a good addition to your wish list. 

During my pursuit of finding an engaging friendship book, I found some beautiful reader reviews for this title. Some of the reviews are added here for you:

<cite>“Oh, this glorious book! With warmth, wit, tenderness, and a singular voice, Catherine Newman encapsulates both the heartbreak and yet vital necessity of a life lived with deep friendship.”</cite> - WIZ WHARTON.

<cite>“One of those books I will be buying for everyone I know. A funny, moving, beautifully written book...will stay with me for a very long time”</cite> - JENNIE GODFREY.

<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Want-Impossible-Things-friendship/dp/085752898X?crid=1RDVC5ALNGC2G&keywords=we+all+want+impossible+things+catherine+newman&qid=1673033650&sprefix=we+all+wan%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=pjobinson-21&linkId=bec031d8e769c9c381a51af38353ad31&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=085752898X&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=GB&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=pjobinson-21&language=en_GB" ></a><img src="https://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=pjobinson-21&language=en_GB&l=li3&o=2&a=085752898X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The story surrounds two women, Edi and Ash, best friends from childhood face a terrible situation in the form of terminal cancer. Edi and Ash face the tragedy with their strong friendship and wits.

Catherine has given all life elements to the characters in the novel to make it a “stay up late book” for your reading. You can expect deep friendship bond in the novel beautifully written with mixed emotions. 


## 2. Spare: by Prince Harry

Being the youngest son of King Charles III and the late Princess Diana, the life of Prince Harry has always attracted people's attention. Even though The Duke of Sussex had a privileged life, he chose to live an ordinary life. 

After a ten-year-long army service, which included deployment to Afghanistan, he married Meghan Markle, an American actress breaking the usual taboo of royal family practices. 

Spare is an honest revelation of Prince Harry’s insights based on his life experience. The book reveals a different point of view unknown to commoners regarding the royal family life. 

<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spare-Prince-Harry-Duke-Sussex/dp/0857504797?pd_rd_w=ZbJpN&content-id=amzn1.sym.0fda7aac-1695-4f0a-89eb-24bbf1c36412&pf_rd_p=0fda7aac-1695-4f0a-89eb-24bbf1c36412&pf_rd_r=AVXZ693ZV96BVC2SB7YE&pd_rd_wg=SiaNq&pd_rd_r=1b496835-98e6-4253-8790-e209187c341d&pd_rd_i=0857504797&linkCode=li3&tag=pjobinson-21&linkId=9d4c7278ad3a7c0ec4dfdc424c96eb30&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0857504797&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=GB&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=pjobinson-21&language=en_GB" ></a><img src="https://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=pjobinson-21&language=en_GB&l=li3&o=2&a=0857504797" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

<strong> Buy on Amazon: <a href= "https://amzn.to/3k4LV77">https://amzn.to/3k4LV77</a> </strong>

The Duke of Sussex aims to support several British charities with donations that earn from his book. Prince has been working forefront of helping vulnerable children and young adults affected by HIV/AIDS in Botswana and Lesotho.

Spare has already become one of the hot topics in all media room discussions in the UK. The ghost in the book has stirred many pen fights and controversies among dignitaries and royal blood. This book is evidently one of its kind, and you should definitely give it a try.


## 3. Stolen Focus: by Johann Hari

Are you struggling with a lack of focus? Are you feeling low because of the inability to take a progressive step in your life? 

Sometimes we all are motivated and wish to bring changes to our lives. Perhaps we may have the perfect plan to make life better. 

But somehow, we end up in more agony and sadness and feel like a failure. So, what is the x-factor that drags you down? 

For me, that's a lack of focus. Stolen Focus by Johann Hari deals with 12 deep factors that affect our concentration to execute our goals. 

Let's check what some of the celebrities have to say about this bestseller.

<cite>“This book is exactly what the world needs right now”</cite> - OPRAH WINFREY
